# This is the Magario's website PWA project.

The Magaro PWA is our first attempt to make a Progressive Web App for our main website, the Magario.com website.

## Getting Started

Since this is a pure react app, just use:
npm start (you know what to do before that)

### Prerequisites

node
react

```
Those are the main ones.
```

### Installing

I won't write anything as you are supposed to know how to install a simple react app.
(If you don't, you are not a Magario coder)
